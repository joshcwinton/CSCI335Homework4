# CSCI335Homework4 JOSH WINTON

##Part 1: Complete
- Run using:
make creategraphandtest
./creategraphandtest Graph1.txt AdjacencyQueries1.txt

##Part 2: Mostly Complete
- Run using:
make findpaths
./findpaths Graph2.txt 1

- It seems like Dijkstra works properly but I'm having trouble with my function to print the shortest path, particularly, when to stop printing. The textbook just says to stop when the next item in the path is not a vertex but I don't even see how this is possible.

- Part 3: Incomplete

## BUGS:
-Vector size error?
